A simple python tool to show team members how easy it is to utilise python for automating our daily BAU
Contains:

disc.py -- sample code how to calculate exposure of corridor var swap based on historical time series, needs input: termsheet of that corridor var swap to get the corridor upper and lower limits; the time series of underlying index hsci and spx. 

distri.py -- sample code how to plot different distribution of simulated variables, for research purposes

draft.py  --  sample code how to calculate PFE exposure of vanilla options and other simple products, using monte carlo simulation and assuming stock price follow normal distribution. To run, navigate to line 462, enter the underlying price, strike price, and volatility(annualized) then run the whole piece of code, you will get pvmatrix variable as the simulated present value matrix generated by this product.

updatevolsandvolumes.py -- simple loop through volatility and volume time series to get how many days had occured that the volatility reached max level, and the volume traded when volatility hightened.
